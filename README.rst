Introduction
------------

**Kodo** is a flexible C++ network coding library, intended to be used for
commercial applications and research on implementation of Network
Coding. The library enables researchers to implement new codes and
algorithms, perform simulations and benchmark the coding operations
on any platform where a recent C++ compiler is available. The library
provides a multitude of building blocks and parameters that can be combined
to create codes. For convenience, several codes are predefined and high-level
APIs are provided.
